        <p><h2>User Manual</h2></p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We have built a web application that compares a single crime accident by zip code.
           When a zip code is selected by the user, we filter latitude and longitude within that zip code and
            visualize it on the map. The zip codes are limited to Prince George’s County, Maryland. Within the 
            map it will tag all the accidents in the zip code area, notifying the user of where each accident 
            happened. The data is recovered from 
            <a href="https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents-February-2017-to-Present/wb4e-w4nf" 
            target="_blank">Data Prince George’s crime activity</a>. 
          In regards to this application, the main stakeholder are commuters in the Prince George County area. 
          Traveling into Prince George County, there are various obstacles that can cause users to arrive late
           to their destination. The ultimate goal should provide users an understanding of particular accidents
            that happen on their plan route and from there gives them the opportunity to adjust their commute 
            accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are only two steps to use the application:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>   
            Open the drop-down menu to select a desired zip code</li>
          <li>lick the Check Zip Code button to visualize it on the map</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Developer's Manual</h2>
        <h3>How to install your application and all dependencies</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To start working on this application from your local environment, you should start 
          with downloading the source files from the github repository: bnwokele/Final_Project. This includes 
          the code for the backend and frontend, and the dependencies required to make the application work. 
          The core dependencies for this application are: babel/cli, babel/core, babel/node, babel/ preset-env,
            node-fetch, nodemon, express, and eslint. A gitignore file is also required because once all these 
            dependencies are installed, they come with a lot of files that would take a long time to push to 
            github.
        </p>
        <h3>How to run your application on a server</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To run the application on a local server, you will need to open up a terminal and
           navigate to the folder that stores the source files on your local environment. Then in that folder
            you will install the dependencies with the command npm start. Once all the dependencies are 
            installed and there are no errors or vulnerabilities, run the application on the server by typing
             in the command npm start on the terminal. This allows you to run the application locally. In the 
             server.js file, the port was set to 3000 so to view the frontend of the application, you can 
             navigate to localhost:3000. To run the application on heroku, you need to integrate github with 
             a heroku server. When you deploy it, it builds an application that updates automatically with 
             your commits. You also receive a link to the application where you can view it running on the server.
        </p>
        <h3>How to run any tests you have written for your software</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are currently no tests for the application. This is a task that we hope to 
          tackle in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All requests have a /api endpoint.
          GET - A get request is used to send data from the server to the frontend. In the backend, the data 
          is processed into an object containing zipcodes as keys and arrays of corresponding latitude and 
          longitude as the values. In the front end, the data is used to input the zipcodes into the dropdown 
          menu and also to visualize the longitude and latitude as data points on the map.
          POST - When a user decides to visualize accident data points within a zip code area on the map, 
          they first have to select the desired zip code and click the check zip code button to visualize the 
          data points. When the user clicks the button, the selected zip code is sent to the server using 
          a post request
          PUT - While using the application, users can plot the data points for multiple zip codes. A put 
          request is used to send an array back to the server with an updated list of all the zipcodes the user
           has selected.

          <h3> A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Currently, there is a bug on the application that requires you to reload the page after you initially
           get to the website to be able to view all the zipcodes from the drop-down menu. When you first get
            the website, only a few zip codes are available in the drop-down menu, but reloading/refreshing 
            the page delivers the remaining zip codes. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          # Road-map for future development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insert another map so that users can select two zip codes at the same time and easily compare 
            crime data between them.</li>
          <li>Write tests to make sure the code performs as intended.</li>
          <li>Make use of the data that is sent back to the server from the post and put request. One idea
             might be to send back the streets where the  accidents happened in each zip code that is selected.</li>
        </ul>
