# Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem
The chosen strategies focus on giving the users insight on accidents that happen in particular areas of Prince George’s County. From there our options were to look at intersections by street or use zip codes as a main outlet to pinpoint certain locations. In the end, our solution was using zip codes which would give users more control over the information they are searching for.
 
# Technical system decision rationale
Our goal overall was to create the application with the knowledge and skill our group has. On the technical aspect, we knew we were sticking to the basics such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The team divided into two parts, the front end and back end. The main points were figuring out the back end to connect the data into the application, putting the application on a server, adjusting the zip code with the added drop-down menu. 
 
# How/if your final system helps to address the problem
Our final design might help those visualize which zip code areas contain the most frequent accident activity. This could then lead commuters to decide a different route to take or just bring them more awareness before traveling within PG county.
 
# Challenges faced and impact on final design
Some of the struggles we experienced were integrating our backend map to properly display on our home page. Another was on design elements to adjust HTML so that it  works in unison with the CSS, especially with layout and formatting.
 
# Possible future work directions with this problem
Insert another map so that users can select two zip codes at the same time and easily compare crime data between them.
