# User Manual
We have built a web application that compares a single crime accident by zip code. When a zip code is selected by the user, we filter latitude and longitude within that zip code and visualize it on the map. The zip codes are limited to Prince George’s County, Maryland. Within the map it will tag all the accidents in the zip code area, notifying the user of where each accident happened. The data is recovered from Data Prince George’s crime activity (https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents-February-2017-to-Present/wb4e-w4nf). 
In regards to this application, the main stakeholder are commuters in the Prince George County area. Traveling into Prince George County, there are various obstacles that can cause users to arrive late to their destination. The ultimate goal should provide users an understanding of particular accidents that happen on their plan route and from there gives them the opportunity to adjust their commute accordingly.
 
There are only two steps to use the application:
  - Open the drop-down menu to select a desired zip code
  - click the Check Zip Code button to visualize it on the map
